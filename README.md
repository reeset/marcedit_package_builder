# marcedit_package_builder
Package builder for enterprise users wanting to distribute installers with embedded admin credentials

Compiled files:
* marcedit_package_builder.zip

This program assumes that .NET 4.8 is installed.

To run without building, unzip the marcedit_package_builder.zip file and run the .exe file.

To modify the code -- the Shell program is a dependency to the packager.  Changes to the command line shell behavior happens there.  Changes to the interface happen in the other project.
